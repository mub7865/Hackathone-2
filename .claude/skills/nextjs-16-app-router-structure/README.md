# Skill: nextjs-16-app-router-structure

Purpose: Teach Claude a consistent, reusable way to structure any
Next.js 16+ App Router project.

This Skill defines:

- How to organize the `/app` directory with `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`,
  nested segments, and route groups.
- When to use server vs client components.
- How to wire loading/error/not-found states.
- Two starter templates:
  - `Templates/root-layout.tsx.tpl`
  - `Templates/root-page.tsx.tpl`

Use this Skill in any Next.js App Router project where you want Claude
to follow the same clean structure instead of inventing a new layout
every time.
