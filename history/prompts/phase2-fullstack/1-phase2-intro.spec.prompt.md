## Prompt

"Hackathon II - Todo Spec-Driven Development.md" — this is my hackathon and I have completed Phase 1. You can check it in @phase1/. Now we have to do Phase II, which we will complete in @phase2/. Save this information in history, and also note that all the work of Phase II will be inside @phase2/.
Now tell me, what is included in Phase II?

## Response snapshot

Phase II mein Full-Stack Web Application banana hai jo Phase 1 ke console app ko modern web app mein convert karega. Technology stack: Next.js 16+ frontend, FastAPI backend, SQLModel ORM, Neon PostgreSQL database, Better Auth authentication.

## Outcome

- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable yet
- 📁 Files: phase2/ folder to be created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Setup monorepo structure, create specs, implement features
- 🧠 Reflection: Phase 1 complete, ready to start Phase 2 full-stack development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
