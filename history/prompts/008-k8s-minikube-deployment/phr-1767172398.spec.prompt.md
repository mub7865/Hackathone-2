## Prompt

User ran /sp.clarify to identify and reduce ambiguity in the Kubernetes Minikube Deployment specification.

The spec already contained placeholder content instead of actual spec details. First, the spec was properly filled with user stories, requirements, and success criteria based on the original prompt.

Then 4 clarification questions were asked (in Urdu/Hindi as requested):

1. Default replica counts for frontend and backend deployments?
   Answer: Frontend: 1 replica, Backend: 1 replica (standard dev defaults)

2. What logging level for observability?
   Answer: Full stack: Kubernetes logs + stdout/stderr capture (comprehensive)

3. How should Helm secrets be managed?
   Answer: Manual kubectl secrets + Helm values (simple, secure)

4. Error handling strategy for failures?
   Answer: Auto-retry: Pod restarts automatically until healthy (automated recovery)

All answers were recorded in the spec file's Clarifications section, and functional requirements were updated accordingly.
